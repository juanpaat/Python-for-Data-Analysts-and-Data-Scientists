    "\n",
    "What will this stock be worth tomorrow? What brand of cars appeals more to 18-year-olds? Why is my website traffic plummeting? A question or set of questions allow us to frame each part of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have decided we want to answer some question, we will need to build a **data pipeline** that allows us to get answers. A full data pipeline usually requires some combination of the following:\n",

    "![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cugl5t-W1sE/maxresdefault.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Procurement**: In order to use data, we must first find it. This may be as simple as buying it from an existing source, or as complex as creating a whole economic endeavor that mines data from user behavior. Some business problems can be solved with a singular data source, but many other need data from many different sources.  This uses a lot of coding and domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation**: Once we have acquired our data, we must aggregate it. This usually entails creating a process by which we create more focused sets of data from our original information. One example you may be familiar with is getting the grades of a student and his attendance record together in one single spreadsheet. Sometimes this entails very complex processes such as natural language processing, and some others it may be as simple as joining 2 datasets from a simple id. For this we need mainly coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaning**: We must also clean all this data. Sensors are not perfect, human-inputted values are many times erroneous, flukes of luck and chance affect some outcomes. Whatever the reason, in the real world it is extremely rare to find a dataset without some manner of outliers, data which is suspect. Sometimes before or sometimes after aggregation, we must take care to clean our data of such oddities in order to make sure our conclusions are sound. This uses coding, statistics and domain knowledge in equal measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis**: After we have orderly and clean data, we can analyze it. This means using a complete assortment of tools in order to extract meaning and actionable insights from our information. While computers help, this is usually the one part of the process on which humans are still unbeatable. This is done with domain knowledge for the most part, with a bit of statistics and coding sprinkled on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modeling**: Using our insights and domain knowledge, we can now proceed to create models which allows us to predict future states of the world given the information we've gathered about past states of the world. Models may be as simple as Linear Regressions, or as complex as Ensemble Neural networks. In the end, you may think as all models as a box in which you input an incomplete set of information about the state of a bit of the world -be that the real estate market or the sales projections for the next year- and which outputs a prediction about the present or future of that little piece of existence. All 3 fields of knowledge are mandatory here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentation**: Finally, we must explain our process, insights and findings. This is often the most underrated skill in novice data scientists, but in many an elder and wise practitioner's mind is the most important of all. After all, our insights and models will not be very actionable if we can't explain them and convince others to act on them. This includes the verbal, written and graphical representation of what we want to convey. Hence, it is advisable that if one is to learn to be great at something in data, that it is the presentation of it.  Domain knowledge is our main asset."

Or, if your data pipeline is designed to serve a large dashboard to be used by many different stakeholders, then your processed data will likely need to be loaded into a database at the end of the pipeline that is [optimized for analytics](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/analytic-database)."

They are usually in the form of **tables** of information, like a spreadsheet, where each row in the spreadsheet is one instance of some part of our data, and each column is a characteristic for that instance.

Almost every relational database can be interacted with through SQL:\n",

PostgreSQL is free, open-source and extremely powerful, which makes it a very attractive option for new projects. It is the database system used by companies such as Instagram, Twitch, and Skype. It even has a very nice graphical interface which allows you to query and observe your data with little to no coding experience, and is one of the top options to get your feet wet with databases in general.

The way in which we model the world in data science is very much rooted in statistics - everything from the simplest models to the most complex (e.g. neural networks) is just applied statistics at its core.\n",

    "One advantage we have as data scientists is that most models have been generalized and coded for us by previous geniuses in the field.

    "However, in order to use it you must know Python (and `pandas`) as well. Linear Regression? Logistic Regression? Decision Trees? Ensembles? `scikit-learn` has it all. Most of its models are part of the bigger field of **machine learning**, in which you input tons and tons of data into your computer in order to get as accurate a model as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice thing about `scikit-learn` is its ease of use, which allows even people who have no idea what a model does internally to test it out anyways. Many aspiring data scientists were inspired to learn the math behind the models after seeing the results of them first-hand. This allows even non-math inclined people to dip their toes in machine learning without much time commitment."

    "Now, your infrastructure can be local (commonly referred to as **on-prem**) or in the **cloud**. When your infrastructure is local, it means that you bought or rented computers and have them available geographically close to you (i.e. you may have your own data center full of servers). This means that you must maintain them, keep them cool with AC, pick out the parts for each computer, and keep a team to make sure everything is running smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is having everything in the cloud. This means nothing more than renting a computer on someone elseâ€™s premises and connecting to it over the Internet. Then, you run all your processes on that computer the same as if it was local, but you don't have to worry about maintenance costs and such.\n",
