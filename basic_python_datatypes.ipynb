    "But what is artificial intelligence? AI is the ability to enable computers to understand data, learn from the data, and make decisions based on patterns hidden in the data. This sounds a lot like Machine Learning. In fact, machine learning tools are implementations of AI. These ML tools perform tasks that could otherwise be very difficult, if not impossible, for humans to perform manually. "
