    "* `.csv`: Comma-Separated Value files. This is your standard rows-and-columns table format that you've seen in DataFrames. A common way of sharing `.csv` files is compressing them as `.csv.gz` files, which greatly reduces their size. You can [do that](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46073397/6945498) in `pandas` pretty easily.\n",
    "* `.json`: JSON files. These are very similar to Python dictionaries. They are popular alternatives to `.csv` files because they usually consume a lot less memory, but they are also less human-readable. We will cover these later in this case.\n",
    "* `.xlsx`: Excel files. Generally, you should avoid using the deprecated Excel `.xls` format ([here's](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988) a reason why).\n",

    "There are other formats that `pandas` is capable of exporting to (check the [docs](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/io.html) for more information). In our case, the bike share company didn't ask for a specific format, so giving the final output as a `.csv` file should be a safe option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've decided on the format, let's think about the encoding. Encodings are basically glossaries that translate between binary numbers (numbers made up of just zeros and ones - which is what your computer understands) and human-language characters. There are quite a few encodings, but the international standard nowadays is Unicode, specifically [`UTF-8`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), and should be your first choice unless you are explicitly required to use a different one."

    "When we talk about achieving consistency in a dataset, we are referring to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data type consistency.** This refers to having all the features represented in the right data type. Thus, if you're working in `pandas`, decimal numbers must be represented as `float`, integers as `int`, strings as `object`, categories as `category`, and so on. Other examples of data type consistency are converting Yes/No columns into booleans (`True`, `False`), making sure all dates are correctly formatted and are not treated as strings or numbers, and rounding decimal numbers to an appropriate precision.\n",
    "    1. As an aside, keep in mind that `pandas` doesn't allow missing values in columns of the `int` data type, so if you need to have `NaN`s in your Series, you'll need to use `float`.\n",
    "2. **Unit consistency.** If you have numerical features, it is important that they are in the right units. For example, if you have one feature in kilometers and another one in miles, you have to convert them to a common unit before you can do math involving both of them.\n",
    "3. **Categorical consistency.** Features that are supposed to be categorical should be standardized. For instance, if your dataset has one category `bike` that is represented by two different strings (e.g. `bike` and `bicycle`), then you have to detect this inconsistency and correct it (e.g. by replacing all instances of `bicycle` with `bike`, to have only one label per category).\n",
    "4. **String formatting.** Sometimes you will have extraneous elements in your strings, like asterisks and other special characters. These are often not useful, so you need to remove them. Other string formatting tasks might include removing punctuation, capitalizing, lowercasing or uppercasing, removing leading and trailing spaces, etc.\n",
    "5. **Referential integrity.** Each unique observation in your dataset should have a unique ID, especially if you plan to join it with other datasets (in which case the IDs of your observations must match the join keys of the other dataset). Often times, this requires that you remove duplicate rows and create IDs for rows that don't have them.\n",
    "6. **Column name consistency.** You don't have to be as strict with this one as with the previous requirements, but being consistent with how you name columns is nonetheless a good practice. You can set all your columns to follow a common naming standard so that their names are meaningful and referring to them in the future is easy."

    "Remove what is not relevant for you. Some years. some colums that are redundant. All this depending on your question and your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guaranteeing that your dataset contains only the relevant information implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removing unnecessary features or observations.** This depends on what your client would like to use the data for. Unnecessary columns could be columns that contain the same information as other columns, only in a different data type, or columns that simply do not add interesting information. For example, unnecessary observations can be for years we aren't interested in (e.g. \"drop everything before August 2013\") or categories that are not needed for the use case (e.g. \"drop non-registered users\").\n",
    "2. **Staying at the right level of granularity.** If your client needs the data aggregated by month, then deliver it aggregated by month. If they need it aggregated by state instead of zip code, then do that. In general though, unless required otherwise, the recommendation is to always provide the highest level of granularity, that is, the most detailed level of resolution of the data that you can, because while you can easily convert disaggregated data into aggregated data (e.g. taking daily data and grouping by month), it is impossible to do the reverse (convert monthly data to daily data).\n",
    "3. **Properly dealing with missing values.** There are three basic strategies:\n",
    "    1. Drop the rows with missing values\n",
    "    2. Come up with reasonable estimates of what the values should be were they available (this is called **interpolation**)\n",
    "    3. Replace them with an appropriate placeholder (`Not available` is a common one for string variables, and the numbers 0 or -1 are sometimes used for numeric variables)\n",
    "4. **Detecting outliers and dealing with them.** Properly handling outliers is more important at the data modeling stage than the data cleaning stage. Even so, when cleaning datasets you are expected to remove (and possibly replace) outliers that are obviously erroneous data. For example, while in the data cleaning stage you should remove a person who traveled 120 kilometers in 10 minutes on their bike (clearly erroneous data), but if they instead traveled that same distance in one day instead, you should leave it as is because even though the observation is still an outlier, it might still be perfectly valid."
